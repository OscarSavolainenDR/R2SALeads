# React and Tailwind CSS front end for my R2SA website

To build this, as a not-front-end-expert, I based it off the starter version of Elstar React Admin Template.

## Production

In production, this was pushed to a Heroku dyno.

## Documentation

I would recommend referencing the Elstar documentation, including on how to isntall all of the `npm` modules, to avoid any mistranslation.

Visit [here](https://elstar.themenate.net/docs/documentation/introduction) for the documentation.

## Support (for Elstar)
