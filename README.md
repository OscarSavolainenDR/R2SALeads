# React and Tailwind CSS front end for my R2SA website

To build this, as a not-front-end-expert, I based it off the starter version of [Elstar React Admin Template](https://elstar.themenate.net/app/sales/dashboard).

## Production

In production, this was pushed to a Heroku dyno. It communicated with the backend (also hosted on a seperate Heroku dyno instance) via API calls. The API address for the backend is specified in `src/configs
/app.config.js`, e.g. `apiPrefix: 'https://r2sa-v1.herokuapp.com/api/'`

## Documentation

I would recommend referencing the Elstar documentation, including on how to isntall all of the `npm` modules, to avoid any mistranslation.
