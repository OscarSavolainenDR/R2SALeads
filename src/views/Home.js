					Here at Rent 2 SA Leads, we believe in helping you scale your R2SA business.
				</h5>
				
				<br />
				Spend less time searching for properties on OpenRent, Gumtree, Zoopla, etc., and more time growing your business!
				<br />
				<br />
				Rent 2 SA Leads works by scanning all of the top rental websites, and comparing their listings to nearby SAs.
				<br />
				For each listing, we do all of the due diligence. We then upload all of the properties that will work well as SAs to your dashboard!
				<br />
				From there, you can move forward and contact them, knowing that all of the due diligence has been done.
				<br />
				You can even download the due diligence for each listing, and check how many Airbnbs are in the area, how much they earn, what their occupancy rates are, and take a look at their profiles on Airbnb!
				<br />
				<br />
				
				We make finding R2SA Leads easy. Get started by going to Manage Lead Subscriptions, and signing up for your city of choice! 
				<br />
				If you want to check out what the leads look like, go to Leads and see what's looking good in Oxford &#40;we give Leads there for free so you can see what the service is like&#41;.
